# Chess_OOP
This is a terminal-based chess game built in Java, designed using object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism. The game features all standard chess pieces with individually defined movement logic, turn-based play between white and black, and a dynamically rendered board using console output.
Each pieceâ€™s legal moves are determined based on real chess rules, including directional movement and capturing logic. The board state is managed using a HashMap<Position, Piece> for efficient lookups. The game currently ends upon the capture of a king, simulating checkmate, with future plans to implement full check and checkmate detection.
This project was developed to reinforce OOP design in Java and demonstrate principles such as encapsulation and polymorphism in a real-world game simulation.
